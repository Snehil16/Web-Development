    <p style="font-size:150%;">In May 2007, Wafaa Bilal started a month long project which was called <b>Domestic Violence</b> in protest of the Iraq War. He confined himself in a room for a whole month for his project. He wanted to be under surveillance, so he had a camera set up where people could see him 24/7. This whole act was shown on a stream on internet.<br> In addition to this, he had a paintball gun set up which could controlled by the viewers. The viewers were allowed to use the gun and shoot at him.</p>

    <p style="font-size:150%;">This art piece was interesting for me because I am a big fan of first person shooter(FPS) games and it uses paintball gun as a form of art. This artpiece also gives reference to the 9/11 attack. So being located in the U.S., I was also able to relate to the history of U.S. It is considered as the most horrific terrorist on U.S. <br> Moreover, I really liked this spectacular approach to the conflict is intended to appeal to those who might not be open to participating in traditional political discourse. Instead of having individuals demonstrate dramatic emotional outbursts, Domestic Tension will involve them in a fun, interactive video game of the kind they are accustomed to playing.</p>
